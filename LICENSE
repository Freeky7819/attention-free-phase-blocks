ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:

This work introduces resonant architectures as an alternative to attention-based
models. The implementation builds upon:

1. Neural Oscillations Research (Buzsáki, 2006)
2. Kuramoto Synchronization Model (Kuramoto, 1975)
3. Holographic Memory Principles (Gabor, 1948; Pribram, 1991)
4. Phase Vector Memory concept (Novel contribution, 2024)

We are grateful to the open-source AI research community for creating the
foundational tools (PyTorch, Transformers) that made this work possible.
